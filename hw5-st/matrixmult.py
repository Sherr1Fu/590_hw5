# This function takes 2 matricies (as lists of lists)
# and performs matrix multiplication on them.
# Note: you may not use any matrix multiplication libraries.
# You need to do the multiplication yourself.
# For example, if you have
#     a=[[1,2,3],
#        [4,5,6],
#        [7,8,9],
#        [4,0,7]]
#     b=[[1,2],
#        [3,4],
#        [5,6]]
#  Then a has 4 rows and 3 columns.
#  b has 3 rows and 2 columns.
#  Multiplying a * b results in a 4 row, 2 column matrix:
#  [[22, 28],
#   [49, 64],
#   [76, 100],
#   [39, 50]]
def matrix_mul(a,b):
    # Write me
    return a
