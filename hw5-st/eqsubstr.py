# Write a function, which when iven one string (s) and two characters
# (c1 and c2), computes all pairings of contiguous ranges of c1s
# and c2s that have the same length.  Your function should return
# a set of three-tuples.  Each element of the set should be
# (c1 start index, c2 start index, length)
#
# Note that s may contain other characters besides c1 and c2.
# Example:
#  s = abcabbaacabaabbbb
#      01234567890111111  <- indices for ease of looking
#                1123456
#  c1 = a
#  c2 = b
#  Observe that there are the following contiguous ranges of 'a's (c1)
#  Length 1: starting at 0, 3, 9
#  Length 2: starting at 6, 11
#  And the following contiguous ranges of 'b's (c2)
#  Length 1: starting at 1, 10
#  Length 2: starting at 4
#  Length 4: starting at 13
#  So the answer would be
#  { (0, 1, 1), (0, 10, 1), (3, 1, 1), (3, 10, 1), (9, 1, 1), (9, 10, 1),
#    (6, 4, 2), (11, 4, 2)}
#  Note that the length 4 range of 'b's does not appear as there are no
#  Length 4 runs of 'a's.

def matching_length_sub_strs(s, c1, c2):

# Makes a random string of length n
# The string is mostly comprised of 'a' and 'b'
# So you should use c1='a' and c2='b' when
# you use this with matching_length_sub_strs
